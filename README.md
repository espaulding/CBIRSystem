This was a class project designed by Professor Min Chen. 
The goal of this project was to make a very simple search engine for images, using no textual meta data whatsoever. Later stages of the project added user interaction in the form of Relevance Feedback, which was a simplified form of what is described in [Rui et al. 1998]. I also read another article for a broader perspective, but only ended up using techniques described in the classroom lectures [Müller et al. 2000].
